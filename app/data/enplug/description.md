Enplug is the first large-scale open platform for digital displays. Enplugâ€™s software, DisplayOS, turns any TV or HD display into an interactive tool. The Enplug App Market lets you choose to show a variety of content on your display ranging from live social media feeds, product videos, news feeds, weather, and more. Viewers can instantly post Tweets, Instagram photos, and more onto the display by #hashtagging the store's name. On average, Enplug increases customers' social media interactions with a store by 500% within the first month, turning the store's customers into brand ambassadors.

Thousands of companies around the world use Enplug inside their businesses. Look for Enplug at Marriott hotels, Alaskan Brewing Co., SupperClub restaurants, Dodger Stadium, and Los Angeles International Airport.
